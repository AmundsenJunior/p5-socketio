# p5-socketio
Getting started with a collaborative drawing app from [the p5.js wiki](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js,-node.js,-socket.io) and [the 'Live Web' course at NYU's ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/liveweb_fall2014/week3.html).
This app uses NodeJS and Socket.IO to serve a p5.js canvas that can be edited in real-time by multiple users.
